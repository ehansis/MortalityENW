# MortalityENW

Preprocessing for a data viz exercise with mortality data from England and Wales

## Data sources

* [Deaths registered in England and Wales â€“ 21st century mortality](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/the21stcenturymortalityfilesdeathsdataset)
* [The 20th Century Mortality Files, 1901 to 2000](https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160111174808/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-215593)

Data files are expected (unzip'd) in `../rawdata`, relative to this file.

## Process

All code is in `process.py`.

* Load data tables for every 5th data year, 1915 to 2000
* Map ICD codes to categories (communicable, injuries, ...) according to the Annex of [Health Statistics Quarterly - No. 18, Summer 2003: Twentieth Century Mortality Trends in England and Wales](https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160110132842/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/hsq/health-statistics-quarterly/no--18--summer-2003/twentieth-century-mortality-trends-in-england-and-wales.pdf). Translation tables are hardcoded in `process.py`. NOTE: the table in the paper has some typos in the group codes, overlaps between groups... !
* Keep top N ICD codes per data year, aggregate others to 'Other communicable diseases', 'Other injuries', ...
* Attach ICD descriptions to retained codes
* Dump everything into a CSV file in `../outdata/`, relative to this file
